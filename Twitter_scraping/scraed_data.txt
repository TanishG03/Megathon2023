Maryam Mirzakhani was an                   inspiration for me, my daughters and so many others. Gone far                   too soon, rest in peace.
Thank you  @narendramodi  for an insightful meeting. It’s                   inspiring to see the government’s deep focus on sustainable and                   inclusive economic growth led by digital transformation and                   we’re looking forward to helping India realize the Digital India                   vision and be a light for the world
My congratulations to  @isro on the moon landing of the                   Chandrayaan-3. What an exciting moment for India – and the                   future of space exploration.
This must be what a professional                   player lives for – to be a cricketer’s cricketer! And yes, for a                   brief moment, the T20s captured the drama of Test                   cricket!

In this next phase of our                   partnership with  @OpenAI, we will deliver the best AI                   infrastructure, models, and toolchain for customers to safely                   and responsibly build and run their applications on                   Azure.
Here's my annual letter to                   shareholders, a look at how we're reimagining every layer of our                   tech stack in this new age of AI—and our growing opportunity                   ahead.

It’s an honor to receive a Padma                   Bhushan Award and to be recognized with so many extraordinary                   people. I’m thankful to the President, Prime Minister, and                   people of India, and look forward to continuing to work with                   people across India to help them use technology to achieve                   more.
I am heartbroken by the current                   situation in India. I’m grateful the U.S. government is                   mobilizing to help. Microsoft will continue to use its voice,                   resources, and technology to aid relief efforts, and support the                   purchase of critical oxygen concentration devices.

Thank you  @narendramodi  for an insightful meeting. It’s                   inspiring to see the government’s deep focus on sustainable and                   inclusive economic growth led by digital transformation and                   we’re looking forward to helping India realize the Digital India                   vision and be a light for the world
My congratulations to  @isro on the moon landing of the                   Chandrayaan-3. What an exciting moment for India – and the                   future of space exploration.
This must be what a professional                   player lives for – to be a cricketer’s cricketer! And yes, for a                   brief moment, the T20s captured the drama of Test                   cricket!

Three billion people look to                   gaming for entertainment, community, and achievement and our                   ambition is to empower each of them, wherever they play. Today                   is a step forward on that journey as we welcome the beloved                   studios and franchises of  @Bethesda  to  @Xbox
Today, we are thrilled to launch                    @Halo Infinite, the latest chapter in                   the legendary franchise that has captivated gamers for over 20                   years. Welcome back, Master Chief!
Here's my annual letter to                   shareholders, a look at how we're reimagining every layer of our                   tech stack in this new age of AI—and our growing opportunity                   ahead.
Last hour of the last day of the                   last test. Test series for the ages. Congrats to Team                   India!
It’s an honor to receive a Padma                   Bhushan Award and to be recognized with so many extraordinary                   people. I’m thankful to the President, Prime Minister, and                   people of India, and look forward to continuing to work with                   people across India to help them use technology to achieve                   more.
I am heartbroken by the current                   situation in India. I’m grateful the U.S. government is                   mobilizing to help. Microsoft will continue to use its voice,                   resources, and technology to aid relief efforts, and support the                   purchase of critical oxygen concentration devices.

The moments that change our lives                   can also be a catalyst to empower others.
"The programmer, like the poet,                   works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff." RIP Fred                   Brooks. Your work and your words will continue to inspire                   generations of software and systems professionals.
Together with Kroger, we are                   applying the power of Azure and Azure AI to redefine the                   shopping experience for millions of customers at both Kroger and                   other retailers around the world.
Each of us needs a digital                   identity we control, which provides us a secure, instant way to                   verify our identity with whomever we want, whenever we want.                   We’re partnering with Mastercard to make this vision a                   reality.
I am appalled by the ongoing acts                   of hate against Asian Americans and the Asian community                   globally. Racism, hate and violence have no place in our                   society. I am united with the Asian and Asian American community                   in standing against this injustice.

Microsoft + GitHub = Empowering                   Developers
Three billion people look to                   gaming for entertainment, community, and achievement and our                   ambition is to empower each of them, wherever they play. Today                   is a step forward on that journey as we welcome the beloved                   studios and franchises of  @Bethesda  to  @Xbox
Today, we are thrilled to launch                    @Halo Infinite, the latest chapter in                   the legendary franchise that has captivated gamers for over 20                   years. Welcome back, Master Chief!
Here's my annual letter to                   shareholders, a look at how we're reimagining every layer of our                   tech stack in this new age of AI—and our growing opportunity                   ahead.
Last hour of the last day of the                   last test. Test series for the ages. Congrats to Team                   India!
It’s an honor to receive a Padma                   Bhushan Award and to be recognized with so many extraordinary                   people. I’m thankful to the President, Prime Minister, and                   people of India, and look forward to continuing to work with                   people across India to help them use technology to achieve                   more.
I am heartbroken by the current                   situation in India. I’m grateful the U.S. government is                   mobilizing to help. Microsoft will continue to use its voice,                   resources, and technology to aid relief efforts, and support the                   purchase of critical oxygen concentration devices.
Thank you  @narendramodi  for an insightful meeting. It’s                   inspiring to see the government’s deep focus on sustainable and                   inclusive economic growth led by digital transformation and                   we’re looking forward to helping India realize the Digital India                   vision and be a light for the world
My congratulations to  @isro on the moon landing of the                   Chandrayaan-3. What an exciting moment for India – and the                   future of space exploration.
This must be what a professional                   player lives for – to be a cricketer’s cricketer! And yes, for a                   brief moment, the T20s captured the drama of Test                   cricket!
