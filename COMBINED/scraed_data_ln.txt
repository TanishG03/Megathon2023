When We Met ❤️ : Some learnings for students Saw him first time on YouTube when I was in Class 11th. Almost 8 years later I got the opportunity to be his guest. After the seminar we had an amazing discussion about Life, Goals and Vision. Top three things I admire about him are -1. Perseverance (giving value from more than 10+ years)2. Very Punctual & Organized 3. A Family Man He has not only created a successful bootsrap company but also took care of his family and health.As a college student always listen to your callings. Learn what you want to learn (as side hustle). Start today so that you can be proud tomorrow ❤️hashtag#aasanHai

15th October 2022 was when I thought of changing my fate by enrolling myself in an unpredictably excellent placement-oriented course named "ALPHA 2.0" by none other than AMAN DHATTARWAL bhaiya and Shradha Khapra didi. Basically ALPHA is an integrated placement-oriented course where one can get to learn #java and #datastructures & #algorithms from the very basics to the extreme advance by which one can easily crack any job at their dream company.The classes were going to start on the 1st of November 2022 so I got time to be mentally prepared when and how to manage my college and Alpha. When it started first few days passed like flash but then I got the dates of my 7th-semester exams and I really panicked but then planned to postpone the course for a while till my semester ends. After it ended I again started it from the beginning and from 1st January 2023 till now, not a single day is missed. As time passed, one will automatically get the essence of #consistency and will enjoy the process of limitless #learning. I don't know if I'm late in posting this affirmation but I'm 100% sure that this course will take my learnings and knowledge to another level which will help me in the long run. I would love to thank AMAN DHATTARWAL bhaiya and Shradha Khapra didi and their team for designing this structured and promising placement-oriented course because this is going to help the entire student community who are looking for jobs and upskilling their knowledge. I have dreamt to meet AMAN DHATTARWAL bhaiya and Shradha Khapra didi and through all your blessings if everything goes well, who knows I might get to meet you. Hopefully going to share the news soon of joining my dream company after completing this course. Just manifesting it today 😅#apnacollege #amanbhaiya #shradhadidi #softwareengineer #alpha

Exciting news, everyone! I just completed a course on graph algorithms in Java from Apna College by Shradha Khapra and AMAN DHATTARWAL  bhaiya and it was an absolute game-changer for me. Not only did I deepen my understanding of Java programming but I also learned how to implement various graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's algorithm.One of the most interesting things I learned was how graph algorithms can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as network routing and social network analysis. The possibilities are endless!I highly recommend anyone who is interested in Java programming and graph algorithms to take a course like this. It will not only enhance your programming skills but also open up new doors for career opportunities.As always, I'm open to connecting with like-minded individuals and discussing all things Java and graph algorithms. Let's continue to learn and grow together! #JavaProgramming #GraphAlgorithms #CareerDevelopment #network #programming #java #like #careeropportunities #algorithms #alpha day 12 #newworld2023

Defamation is a punishable offence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 1. Calling somebody scammer & fraud repeatedly & continuously is not criticism of marketing or product. It is defamation.2. He misled people and made false claims on social media regarding the package of our student.3. We requested him to remove the defamatory and derogatory statements from his social media. Instead of removing the incorrect and false statements, he publicly made fun of it.4. For a case to be filed in High Court, the same has to be valued min. Rs. 2 crore and the same has been filed by following due process of law. And now he is misleading people by making a false statement regarding the case filed. Please be smart, please don’t be misled.#rajvikramaditya
Thank you so much for your love and respect, AMAN DHATTARWAL (Aman Bhaiya) and Shradha Khapra (Microsoft Wali Didi). When I met both of you, it was an incredible experience for me. Thank you very much for providing me with such a valuable gift, the MacBook Air.Diwali is the festival of lights and happiness, and this MacBook adds a lot of light to my life on this occasion. It is special to me because it is my first laptop that I have ever owned. It will increase my productivity.After meeting with both of you, I feel energized to strengthen in life and be productive. Every lesson I learned from you, I will apply in my life.Thank you so much for your love, kindness, and hospitality. I am proud to be an #Alphait and will make you proud as well. #Alphait #apnacollege #FirstLaptop #macbookair #thankyou
One of our student is scared.This student has done nothing wrong, his only fault is that he got an International Offer.Fact : Our student got INTERNATIONAL Internship in FAANG (7lakh/month)But some people have misrepresented this saying - “India mai itna internship koi nahi deta”Yes, India mai nahi dete, that’s why it was clearly mentioned in the video that he got an International Offer.This student is now scared as many people have claimed or posted/retweeted his achievement as Fake.His first personal message to us (2days ago) was - that I want to completely dedicate my selection in FAANG to Apna College & Alpha (screenshot attached).It’s sad and disheartening to read such false posts. This student is so much scared right now, I have personally talked to him 2-3 times over call just to make him feel secured.Interviews of our placed students will be coming this week on Apna College channel.#loveYouAll3000 #students

Exciting news, everyone! I just completed a course on graph algorithms in Java from Apna College by Shradha Khapra and AMAN DHATTARWAL  bhaiya and it was an absolute game-changer for me. Not only did I deepen my understanding of Java programming but I also learned how to implement various graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and Prim's algorithm.One of the most interesting things I learned was how graph algorithms can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as network routing and social network analysis. The possibilities are endless!I highly recommend anyone who is interested in Java programming and graph algorithms to take a course like this. It will not only enhance your programming skills but also open up new doors for career opportunities.As always, I'm open to connecting with like-minded individuals and discussing all things Java and graph algorithms. Let's continue to learn and grow together! #JavaProgramming #GraphAlgorithms #CareerDevelopment #network #programming #java #like #careeropportunities #algorithms #alpha day 12 #newworld2023

Defamation is a punishable offence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 1. Calling somebody scammer & fraud repeatedly & continuously is not criticism of marketing or product. It is defamation.2. He misled people and made false claims on social media regarding the package of our student.3. We requested him to remove the defamatory and derogatory statements from his social media. Instead of removing the incorrect and false statements, he publicly made fun of it.4. For a case to be filed in High Court, the same has to be valued min. Rs. 2 crore and the same has been filed by following due process of law. And now he is misleading people by making a false statement regarding the case filed. Please be smart, please don’t be misled.#rajvikramaditya

One of our student is scared.This student has done nothing wrong, his only fault is that he got an International Offer.Fact : Our student got INTERNATIONAL Internship in FAANG (7lakh/month)But some people have misrepresented this saying - “India mai itna internship koi nahi deta”Yes, India mai nahi dete, that’s why it was clearly mentioned in the video that he got an International Offer.This student is now scared as many people have claimed or posted/retweeted his achievement as Fake.His first personal message to us (2days ago) was - that I want to completely dedicate my selection in FAANG to Apna College & Alpha (screenshot attached).It’s sad and disheartening to read such false posts. This student is so much scared right now, I have personally talked to him 2-3 times over call just to make him feel secured.Interviews of our placed students will be coming this week on Apna College channel.#loveYouAll3000 #students

15th October 2022 was when I thought of changing my fate by enrolling myself in an unpredictably excellent placement-oriented course named "ALPHA 2.0" by none other than AMAN DHATTARWAL bhaiya and Shradha Khapra didi. Basically ALPHA is an integrated placement-oriented course where one can get to learn #java and #datastructures & #algorithms from the very basics to the extreme advance by which one can easily crack any job at their dream company.The classes were going to start on the 1st of November 2022 so I got time to be mentally prepared when and how to manage my college and Alpha. When it started first few days passed like flash but then I got the dates of my 7th-semester exams and I really panicked but then planned to postpone the course for a while till my semester ends. After it ended I again started it from the beginning and from 1st January 2023 till now, not a single day is missed. As time passed, one will automatically get the essence of #consistency and will enjoy the process of limitless #learning. I don't know if I'm late in posting this affirmation but I'm 100% sure that this course will take my learnings and knowledge to another level which will help me in the long run. I would love to thank AMAN DHATTARWAL bhaiya and Shradha Khapra didi and their team for designing this structured and promising placement-oriented course because this is going to help the entire student community who are looking for jobs and upskilling their knowledge. I have dreamt to meet AMAN DHATTARWAL bhaiya and Shradha Khapra didi and through all your blessings if everything goes well, who knows I might get to meet you. Hopefully going to share the news soon of joining my dream company after completing this course. Just manifesting it today 😅#apnacollege #amanbhaiya #shradhadidi #softwareengineer #alpha
