Cricket is more than just a game. For every Indian, cricket is an emotion 🇮🇳 I still remember the day we got Hardik Pandya as the first ever boAthead. And since then our association with cricket has only been growing from more boAtheads to IPL teams. I am excited to announce that this year, we are a part of the biggest cricketing event- ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023.Manifesting India's win 🤞🏻 as we take over the world in every sense. 🇮🇳#TheMoveOfChampions #CWC23Sameer Mehta

They say Rome wasn’t built in a Day, and I say India won’t make in a Day.Even when Suzuki came to India, an ecosystem of component manufacturers was developed with time, that complemented eachother to collectively grow. We need the Semiconductor giants to start making in India so companies like us are truly able to make in India for the world. 🇮🇳 At SemiconIndia 2023 in Gandhinagar, it was a pleasure sharing the vision about how brands like ours will also benefit and give back more when this ecosystem is developed. Our dream of making world class tech products in India and self reliance in the tech industry is just getting fueled. 🇮🇳🇮🇳

No force can stop us. Our time has come. 🇮🇳I used to see second and third gen entrepreneurs at state visits as official delegation with the Prime Minister. I am so so happy, humbled and proud to state that now new age entrepreneurs like me and younger startups like ours are also being invited.Thank you to the Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi  and the Government of India for taking me along with you to Paris. 🙏Speaking about Make In India and Indian Startups at the Indo-French CEO Forum, meeting the French Ministers, bureaucrats and Corporates at the State dinner at Louvre and watching the Bastille Day Parade where the Indian Contingent played Sare Jahaan Se Acha and my heart just filled up with happiness and pride. 🫡And this, my friends is my new India where we Stand shoulder to shoulder with the world and this is our decade. Here's to building a stronger nation. Jai Hind. 🇮🇳🇮🇳#UnstoppableIndia.
Founders will be measured on IQ, EQ and now GQ apart from other things. Governance quotient now will become more important than ever and it’s good for the ecosystem that Corporate Governance is taken seriously from Day Zero.
Presenting to you, our new Workspace or should I call it our new Space where we spend so much time together. After coming back from Covid, I could feel resistance in the team (including me) to come back to office. Hence wanted to give us a space where it feels like a place where we belong.The space has been designed to invoke a sense of pride and belonging not just through visual branding but truly living the brand philosophy of #DoWhatFloatsYourboAt The workspace matches the unique work culture at boAt that promotes self-discovery, blends diverse workstyles and ideologies, and enhances employee engagement and collaboration that embodies boAt’s DNA.Welcome to our new Club.
This World Music Day, we wanted to step apart from the mainstream and celebrate India’s emerging talent. The talent that often faces the brunt of competing with the algorithm.So today we wanted to lend our platform to amplify the voices of these emerging artists. We broke the algorithm through strategic contextual placement on YouTube ads. Also Bringing to life the dream of these artists to become billboard artists through innovative #QR ART.  The #BreakThroughMusic campaign was all about  technology, artists, art, dreams and cool talent. This post is a shoutout for all breakthrough artists. Happy World Music Day Everyone #marketing #techinnovation #AR #qrart
Worlds first, by an Indian Brand. 🇮🇳 Indians to Others be like : Hum Bhee World’s First Bana LengeThat’s what we did yesterday. We launched Worlds First Dolby powered neckband by boAt Labs - Nirvana 525ANC.I used to see other mobile brands like Apple, always do events to launch their phones. And boAt being boAt, we wanted to take that a notch above. Launching the coolest neckband with our first tech event. Here’s to our tech ninjas who keep us at the forefrontof delivering high-end affordable tech. Here’s to the entire team for reaching another big milestone.Sameer Mehta 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Adding the 10X factor to Marketing!boAt wins the Highest number of awards at the afaqs!

Pleasure learning, unlearning, sharing, discussing, laughing and celebrating with D2C Founders.When boAt started, the term "D2C brand" was unheard of; we would typically be called an online brand, or marketplace  seller etc. There was barely any respect given to born-in-India brands. Cut to 2023, people proudly prefer Indian brands over Firangi ones and D2C commands unquestionable respect!We are here to stay and slay. 💪🏼Sameer Mehta
At boAt, we are on a mission to bring Technologically superior products for the discerning Indian Consumers. Happy Technology Day to our tech ninjas who've made it possible for us to do this at a logical price for the discerning Indian Consumers. 🤜🏼🤛🏼Qualcomm Dolby Laboratories Mimi Hearing Technologies Seva Dirac  boAt Lifestyle Sameer Mehta
That's a sight you can't unsee! Some see this that Ganguly is patting Kohli and Kohli reciprocating the respect for Ganguly. Looking closely, some see iconic brands JBL and boAt. 🤜🏼🤛🏼What I see is "my ex employer (JBL) telling me that boAt is doing decently well". ☺️The experienced, the formidable campaigner, respected everywhere, represents JBL, and the aggressive, young insurgent, the leader of the day, represents boAt.Competition is always good for the consumers. Competitors can respect each other and brings the best out of each other. Creating better products for everyone, every day.
Never ever stop dreaming. I always dreamt of flying on a private plane. Bucket list thing. Done. Now hustling to achieve the next one. Keep Dreaming. Keep Hustling. #HumBhee…. ☺️P.S : I don’t own one, yet. 😉

Pleasure learning, unlearning, sharing, discussing, laughing and celebrating with D2C Founders.When boAt started, the term "D2C brand" was unheard of; we would typically be called an online brand, or marketplace  seller etc. There was barely any respect given to born-in-India brands. Cut to 2023, people proudly prefer Indian brands over Firangi ones and D2C commands unquestionable respect!We are here to stay and slay. 💪🏼Sameer Mehta
At boAt, we are on a mission to bring Technologically superior products for the discerning Indian Consumers. Happy Technology Day to our tech ninjas who've made it possible for us to do this at a logical price for the discerning Indian Consumers. 🤜🏼🤛🏼Qualcomm Dolby Laboratories Mimi Hearing Technologies Seva Dirac  boAt Lifestyle Sameer Mehta
That's a sight you can't unsee! Some see this that Ganguly is patting Kohli and Kohli reciprocating the respect for Ganguly. Looking closely, some see iconic brands JBL and boAt. 🤜🏼🤛🏼What I see is "my ex employer (JBL) telling me that boAt is doing decently well". ☺️The experienced, the formidable campaigner, respected everywhere, represents JBL, and the aggressive, young insurgent, the leader of the day, represents boAt.Competition is always good for the consumers. Competitors can respect each other and brings the best out of each other. Creating better products for everyone, every day.
Never ever stop dreaming. I always dreamt of flying on a private plane. Bucket list thing. Done. Now hustling to achieve the next one. Keep Dreaming. Keep Hustling. #HumBhee…. ☺️P.S : I don’t own one, yet. 😉
